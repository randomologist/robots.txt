        <center><h1>My expeirience with Lightbot</h1>
        <p>Lightbot is a game developed by a highschooler.<br>
        the game teaches yo the basics of code using block coding<br>
        The challenges start easy but get harder as you go<br>
        It teaches you about functions and loops and other concepts.
        Loops are pieces of code that run several times in one line.<br>
        functions are pieces of codes that you can call on to use to not have to retype code.
        robomind is a game similar to lightbot but simpler and with less levels.<br>
        but it does one thing better than lightbot which is use actual typing.
