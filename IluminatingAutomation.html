        <center><h1>My expeirience with Lightbot</h1>
        <p>Lightbot is a game developed by a highschooler.<br>
        the game teaches yo the basics of code using block coding<br>
        The challenges start easy but get harder as you go<br>
        It teaches you about functions and loops and other concepts.
        Loops are pieces of code that run several times in one line.<br>
        functions are pieces of codes that you can call on to use to not have to retype code.
        robomind is a game similar to lightbot but simpler and with less levels.<br>
        but it does one thing better than lightbot which is use actual typing.

            <p>the right arrow makes it turn right, the left arrow makes it turn left,<br>
                the lightbot figure is to jump,f1 is function one where you can put code to call on,<br>
                f2 is the second function,the zigzag line is to stop functions,<br>
                and the color means if you are a certain color you execute the command <br>
                the straight  is to move forward.</p>
